# BikeApp3

This is a .NET Razor pages application that lets users view Bike Routes near and around Oak Park as well as view events. It is currently in development. Hopefully soon I can deploy it to Azure. The application has simple authentication/authorization. Anonymous users can view data but not Create/Update/Delete. Members can currently CRUD, but authorization must be hard-coded.

As of 14-September, I am redoing the UI, and that is on the branch entitled "Adding Events". Sorry for the poor naming convention!

Questions?
